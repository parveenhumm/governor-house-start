//conclusion:- Tuples are fixed length array with particular typeas 
//readonly keyword makes the tuples immutable (elements can not be changed after creation)
//push method can be used to add element to an array but it can not be used in readonly tuples

//define our readonly tuple
const ourReadonlyTuple2 : readonly [number ,boolean ,string] = [5 , true , 'The Real codder']
//throws an error as it is readonly.
/////urReadonlyTuple2.push('codder took a day off');

//Named Tuples:-  provides detaled names for each elements.This increases readibility and makes code self explainatory
 const graph :[x:number , y: number] = [55.2 , 41.3];

// destructing Tuples:- 
const graph1 :[number , number] = [55.2 , 41.3];
const[x , y] = graph1; //unpacking values of graph or destructing or separating values into diferent varaibles
//Benefits:-Concise syntax: Simplifies code by assigning values directly to variables.
//Improved readability: Makes code more expressive and easier to understand.
//Efficiency: Can be used to avoid unnecessary intermediate variables.
